A Library Management System in C is a software application designed to manage library operations like book cataloging, user management, book issue/return, and fine calculation. It typically uses file handling to store book and user records, along with structures and functions for efficient data management. The system allows librarians to add, delete, search, and update book records, as well as track borrowed books. It provides a simple command-line interface for ease of use.
